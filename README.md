# Scramble letters exercise

Can you read the following paragraph?

"Aoccdrnig to rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit a porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe." 

Let's create something similar that can scramble the words in sentences so that they remain legible. 

To simplify the problem of scrambling it would not use random order, but just reverse the inner letters of the word, while keeping the first and last ones in place

## Examples
```
t hin g -> t nih g
w hol e -> w loh e
i mportan t -> i natropm t
p roble m -> p elbor m
```
## How

Implementation can be done in both Java, C++ and Python. It is important to provide unit tests that prove the working solution.

You can choose any kind of framework that suits you the best. Please, provide the necessary build script that compiles your solution and runs the tests with one command.

The problem itself is not difficult. With this excercise we want to emphasise the whole development cycle for a micro project. This means having tests, having a build system, and writing clean and readable code.
